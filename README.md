# BTMC

Official golang implementation of the BTMC protocol.

## What is BTMC?

We set up the Bit Miner Chain (BTMC) project based on the Blockchaintechnology so as to build a decentralized integrated serviceplatform for the transaction of AI chips. The platform will rely on technical characteristics of Blockchain to provide fast and convenient services for global industryparticipants related to AI chips (producers, logistics providers, terminal users, etc.) . In near future, BTMC will also build the public Blockchain to allow more participants of industrial chains to build sub-chains on the public Blockchain, gradually establishing a decentralized AI chip supply system by the Blockchain technology.. Please refer to the [White Paper](http://www.btmc.co/BTMC-whitepaper-V2.2.pdf) for more details.
